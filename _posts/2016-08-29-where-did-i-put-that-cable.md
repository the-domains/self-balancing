title: Where did I put that cable ?
publisher: {}
description: >-
  We know the struggle of finding that HDMI or usb cable or whatever other
  adapter you may need. With our desk that is a thing of the past. With HDMI,
  usb 3.0, thunderbolt, mini HDMI, card reader and mini USB connection cables
  are in the past. So whenever you need to connect you just do it, without the
  hassle of having boxes full of unnecessary cables.
